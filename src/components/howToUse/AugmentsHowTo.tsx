        <h1>Exploring the Role of RNG in TFT Augments</h1>

        <p className="body-small">
          If you're a fan of Teamfight Tactics (TFT), you're probably familiar
          with the concept of "augments." These are small bonuses that can give
          your champions an edge in battle. But are these augments random? In
          this article, we'll explore the role of RNG in TFT augments and what
          it means for your gameplay.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          First, let's define what we mean by "random." In TFT, random elements
          are present in various forms, from champion and item drops to the
          order of rounds and the placement of your opponents. RNG, or random
          number generation, is the mechanism that determines these outcomes.
          So, when we ask whether TFT augments are random, we're really asking
          whether the system that decides which augments you receive is based on
          chance.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          The answer is yes and no. The first Hextech augment is completely
          random, and you have no control over which one you receive. However,
          the second and third Hextech augments are not entirely random. They
          have a higher probability of offering you an augment that suits your
          current board and playstyle.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          The second Hextech augment is offered on stage 3-2, and it has a
          higher chance of giving you an augment that complements your current
          champions. For example, if you have a lot of melee champions on your
          board, you're more likely to get an augment that benefits melee
          champions. This means that you can somewhat control which augment you
          receive by adjusting your team composition.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          The third Hextech augment is offered on stage 4-2, and it has the
          highest probability of offering you an augment that suits your board
          and playstyle. This means that if you've been strategic about your
          team composition and gameplay up to this point, you have a better
          chance of getting an augment that will be particularly helpful for
          your current situation.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          In conclusion, RNG is a significant factor in TFT gameplay, and
          augments are no exception. While the first Hextech augment is entirely
          random, you can somewhat control which augment you receive for the
          second and third ones. By adapting your team composition and
          playstyle, you can increase your chances of getting an augment that
          will benefit you the most. So, embrace the randomness and have fun
          with it!

        <h1>What are Augments in Teamfight Tactics (TFT)?</h1>

        <p className="body-small">
          If you're new to Teamfight Tactics (TFT), you might be wondering what
          "augments" are and how they work. In this article, we'll take a closer
          look at augments and their role in TFT gameplay.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          Augments are small bonuses that can give your champions an edge in
          battle. They are offered to players at certain points during a game,
          and you can choose to accept or decline them. If you accept an
          augment, it will give your champions a temporary boost in power or
          provide some other advantage.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          There are several types of augments in TFT, each with its own unique
          effect. For example, some augments might increase the attack damage or
          attack speed of your champions, while others might provide a shield or
          heal. Some augments might affect all of your champions, while others
          might only affect specific types or classes.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          To obtain augments in TFT, you'll need to complete certain objectives
          or meet specific requirements. For example, you might need to win a
          certain number of rounds, have a certain number of champions on your
          board, or have a specific type of champion in your lineup. Once you've
          met the requirements, you'll be offered a choice of augments to accept
          or decline.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          It's important to note that augments are only temporary, and their
          effects will wear off after a certain amount of time. However, they
          can be a powerful tool for turning the tide of a battle or securing a
          victory in a close game.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          In conclusion, augments are an important part of TFT gameplay,
          providing players with temporary bonuses that can make a big
          difference in battle. By completing objectives and meeting
          requirements, you can earn the right to choose from a variety of
          different augments that can help you achieve victory.

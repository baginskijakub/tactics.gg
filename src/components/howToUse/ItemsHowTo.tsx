        <h1>How Items Work in Teamfight Tactics (TFT)</h1>

        <p className="body-small">
          Items are a crucial component of Teamfight Tactics (TFT), providing
          your champions with powerful bonuses that can help you win battles. In
          this article, we'll take a closer look at how items work in TFT.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          At the beginning of each game, you are given a pool of items to work
          with. Each time you obtain an item, whether by picking it up from a
          carousel or by earning it through other means, that item is removed
          from your pool. As you take one type of item from the pool, the
          chances of getting other item types increase.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          There are several different types of items in TFT, each with its own
          unique effect. Some items might increase your champion's attack damage
          or attack speed, while others might provide a shield or a healing
          effect. You can combine certain items to create even more powerful
          effects, giving you an even greater advantage in battle.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          To use items in TFT, you'll need to equip them to your champions. Each
          champion can hold up to three items, and you can freely move items
          between champions as needed. You can also combine certain items to
          create more powerful items, but be aware that once items are combined,
          they cannot be separated.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          It's important to note that the items you choose can have a
          significant impact on your overall strategy in TFT. Some items might
          work better with certain champions or team compositions, so it's
          important to consider how each item fits into your overall game plan.
        </p>

        <p className="body-small">
          In conclusion, items are a vital aspect of TFT gameplay, providing
          your champions with powerful bonuses that can turn the tide of a
          battle. By strategically choosing and combining items, you can gain an
          edge over your opponents and emerge victorious.
